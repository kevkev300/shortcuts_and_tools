        <h3> Principle of Least Surprise </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Never surprise the user!</b>
          <br>
          A component, in the interface or the code, should behave the same way that the user would expect it.

        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Don't write the same code twice.</b>
          <br>
          Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.

        <h3>KISS - Keep it Simple and Stupid</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

          <br>
          Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
